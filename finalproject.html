        <h3>Sri</h3>
        <p class = "bio"> Hi! My name is Sri! I'm an upcoming junior in highschool, and am currently 15 years old! I live in Torrance, California and am spending my summer at Girls Who Code in El Segundo. I like to hang out with my family, consistng of my brother and my parents. In my free time I do classical Indian Dance, and am in various clubs at my school. Some of my clubs include CSF and robotics. I've been doing robotics for a little over 4 years now and love it! Computer Science is something I'm interested in and hope to pursue it throughout my life. I wanted to work on a website doing with the topic of mental health because it is always something that I have wanted to learn more about! I think it is always important to help others through anythng they go through, and I believe that this website does just that.    </p>

        <h3>Aaliyah</h3>
        <p class = "bio">I'm a 17 year old upcoming senior from Los Angeles, California. I love space. It has fascinated me since I was little. I used to just stare at the sky without even noticing. A few of my hobbies are reading, listening to music, and watching movies. This summer I went to Girls Who Code and got to learn some stuff about computer science. For our final project we decided to make a website. I chose to be in this group becuase mental health is a topic I really care about. I hope this website helps whoever comes across it. </p>

        <h3>Stephany</h3>
        <p class = "bio">I'm a 16-year-old upcoming senior from Los Angeles, California. I like astronomy, physics, drinking tea, and going to the beach. I spent most of my summer at the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program based in El Segundo, California. Here I learned the basics of coding, web development, and robotics. For my final project at this program, I teamed up with another two of my classmates, Sri and Aaliyah, to make this website. I decided to make mental health the topic of my website because I care about this issue strongly and believe that technology and the internet are helpful tools that can be used to spread awareness and encourage healthy coping practices.</p>
